# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis using PySpark

## Project Overview
In this project, we delve into analyzing the electric vehicle (EV) population using the PySpark framework. Leveraging the power of Spark for large-scale data processing, we aim to uncover insights into the adoption and distribution of electric vehicles. The analysis is enriched with visual representations created using various data visualization libraries.

## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis can be accessed from the U.S. Government's open data platform:
[Electric Vehicle Population Data](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/electric-vehicle-population-data)

## Key Objectives
- Analyze the electric vehicle population to understand distribution patterns.
- Identify trends in EV adoption over time.
- Utilize data visualization to represent the findings effectively.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **PySpark**: For scalable data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and prepare data for visualization.
- **Matplotlib & Folium**: For creating informative and interactive visualizations.
- **Google Colab**: Notebook environment for code execution and documentation (if `google.colab` import is used for specific integrations).

## Project Structure
- Data Loading and Preprocessing: Utilizing PySpark for efficient handling of large datasets.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting thorough analysis to uncover underlying patterns and insights.
- Visualization: Employing `matplotlib` and `folium` for static and interactive visual representations of the analysis.
